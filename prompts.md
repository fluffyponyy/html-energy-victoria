## ❇ HTML Energy Prompts ❇

- Try using some tags like \<DIALOG>, \<DETAILS>, \<RUBY>, \<MAP> and \<AREA>.

- Search « [martin rinehart tags past]() » for a list of tags in HTML 1, 2, 3.2, 4.01, and 5, or search « [tim html tags 1991 museum]() ». What can you make with only old tags?

- Depict the scene around you as a hierarchy of elements, maybe some \<UL>s
  representing nested concepts; search « [orteil nested](https://orteil.dashnet.org/nested) » for inspiration.

- What do you hear? Could you record some snippets and use an \<AUDIO> tag?

- Write a hypertextual love letter.

- Make a website like a slinky.

- Web sites have sights and sounds… what can they say about touch, smell, taste?

- Can you go against the grain with some diagonal scrolling?

- Search « [www-talk@w3.org archives](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-talk/) » and look at some really old ones, like the discussion of forms around 18 Nov 1992. What can you do with forms?

- Write something very specific to this place; some info and links below. (If you deign to
  touch a little JavaScript, you could even make it only readable at this time…)

- Write a letter to someone in one of the other cities as handwritten HTML we can send in
  the mail.

- Propose a new tag.
